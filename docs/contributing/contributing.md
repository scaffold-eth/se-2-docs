## Getting Started

You can contribute to this repo in many ways:

- Solve open issues
- Report bugs or feature requests
- Improve the documentation

Contributions are made via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines for contributions:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- Contributions should only fix/add the functionality in the issue OR address style issues, _not both_.
- If you're running into an error, please give context. Explain what you're trying to do and how to reproduce the error.
- Please use the same formatting in the code repository. You can configure your IDE to do this by using the prettier / linting config files included in each package.
- If applicable, please edit the README.md file to reflect changes.
