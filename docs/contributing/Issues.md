# Issues

Issues should be used to report problems, request a new feature, or discuss potential changes before a PR is created.

## Solve an Issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2/issues) to find one that interests you.

If a contributor is working on the issue, they will be assigned to that individual. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to assign it to yourself and open a PR with a fix for it.

## Create a New Issue

If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.

Some tips to follow when you are creating an issue:

- Provide as much context as possible. Over-communicate to give the most detail to the reader.
- Include the steps to reproduce the issue or the reason for adding the feature.
- Screenshots, videos, etc., are highly appreciated.
