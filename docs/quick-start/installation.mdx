# Installation

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Setup

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, you have two options:

1. Use the npx command: `npx create-eth@latest` to bootstrap the project directly.
2. Use git clone to clone the repository.

### Option 1: Setup using `npx create-eth@latest`

For a simplified setup, Scaffold-ETH 2 offers a npx method that guides you interactively through the setup.

Bootstrap the project:

```
npx create-eth@latest
```

You will be presented with a series of prompts:

- **Project Name:** Input your project name: Enter a name for your project, e.g., my-dapp-example.
- **Solidity Framework** What solidity framework do you want to use?: Choose your preferred solidity framework (Hardhat, Foundry)
- **Install packages?:** Press `Enter` for `yes` (default option) or type `n` and press `Enter` for no

Once the setup is complete, navigate to the project directory:

```
cd project-name
```

:::info Hint
If you choose Foundry as solidity framework in the CLI, you'll also need Foundryup installed on your machine.
Checkout: [getfoundry.sh](https://getfoundry.sh/)

If you want to use extensions, you can add the -e flag followed by the extension name:

```
npx create-eth@latest -e extension-name
```

### Option 2: Setup using `git clone`
