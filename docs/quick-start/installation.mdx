# Installation

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (v18 LTS)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Setup

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, you have two options:

1. Use git clone to clone the repository.
2. **[Beta]** Use the npx command: `npx create-eth@latest` to bootstrap the project directly.

### Option 1: Setup using `git clone`

Clone this repo & install dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2.git
cd scaffold-eth-2
yarn install
```

### Option 2: [Beta] Setup using `npx create-eth@latest`

For a simplified setup, Scaffold-ETH 2 offers a beta npx method that guides you interactively through the setup.

Bootstrap the project:

```
npx create-eth@latest
```

You will be presented with a series of prompts:

- **Project Name:** Input your project name: Enter a name for your project, e.g., my-dapp-example.
- **Solidity Framework** What solidity framework do you want to use?: Choose your preferred solidity framework (Hardhat, Foundry)
- **Install packages?:** Press `Enter` for `yes` (default option) or type `n` and press `Enter` for no

Once the setup is complete, navigate to the project directory:

```
cd project-name
```
