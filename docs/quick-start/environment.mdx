description: How to set up your development environment for Scaffold ETH-2.
---

# Environment

Now that our installation is complete, let's configure the development environment for Scaffold ETH-2.

### 1. **Initialize a Local Blockchain**:

In the first terminal, run a local network:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts`.

### 2. **Deploy Your Smart Contract**:

In the second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

### 3. **Launch your NextJS Application**:

In the third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the contract component or the example ui in the frontend.

## What's Next:

- Edit your smart contract `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
- Edit your deployment scripts in `packages/hardhat/deploy`
- Edit your frontend in `packages/nextjs/pages`
- Edit the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`
- Run smart contract test with `yarn hardhat:test`
