# Deploy Your Smart Contracts

To deploy your smart contracts to a live network, there are a few things you need to adjust.

## 1. Configure your network

Scaffold-ETH 2 comes with a selection of predefined networks. To add your custom network:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="dev-tool">
<TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat" default>
```

Go to `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts` and add your network to the `networks` object.

```typescript title="packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts"
networks: {
    // ... other networks
    base: {
        url: "https://mainnet.base.org",
        accounts: [deployerPrivateKey]
    },
}
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">
```

Go to `packages/foundry/foundry.toml` and add your network to the `rpc_endpoints` object.

```toml title="packages/foundry/foundry.toml"
[rpc_endpoints]
...other chains
base = "https://mainnet.base.org"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Here are the [Alchemy docs](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-add-alchemy-rpc-endpoints-to-metamask) for information on specific networks.

You can also add your custom network by following the recipe [here](/recipes/add-custom-chain).

## 2. Generate a new account or add one to deploy the contract(s) from.

The deployer account is the account that will deploy your contracts. Additionally, the deployer account will be used to execute any function calls that are part of your deployment script.

You can generate a random account / private key by running:

```
yarn generate
```

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="dev-tool">
<TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat" default>
```

It will automatically add the encrypted private key (`DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY_ENCRYPTED`) in your `.env` file.

You will be prompted to enter a password which will be used to encrypt your private key. **Make sure to remember this password as you'll need it for future deployments and account queries.**

:::info Info
We are only storing the plain private key in memory, it's never stored in disk files for security reasons. Checkout the code [here](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/create-eth/blob/main/templates/solidity-frameworks/hardhat/packages/hardhat/scripts/generateAccount.ts).
:::info

If you prefer to import your private key, run:

```
yarn account:import
```

You will get prompted to paste your private key and set the encryption password. It will store your encrypted private key in your `.env` file.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">
```

It will automatically generate a new [keystore](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cli/cast/wallet#cast-wallet) with the name `scaffold-eth-custom`.

You will be prompted to enter a password which will be used to encrypt your keystore. **Make sure to remember this password as you'll need it for future deployments and account queries.**

Now you'll need to open your `packages/foundry/.env` file, and update `ETH_KEYSTORE_ACCOUNT=scaffold-eth-custom` to start using the new keystore.

If you prefer to import your private key (you need to delete your `scaffold-eth-custom` keystore first, if exists), run:

```
yarn account:import
```

You will get prompted to paste your private key and set the encryption password. It will store your encrypted private key in the `scaffold-eth-custom` keystore file.

Also if you want to use your existing keystore account you can just update the `ETH_KEYSTORE_ACCOUNT` in your `.env` file, setting the name of your existing keystore.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can check the configured (generated or imported) account and balances with:

```
yarn account
```

You will need to enter your password to decrypt the private key and view the account information and balances.

## 3. Deploy your smart contract(s)

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="dev-tool">
<TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat" default>
```

By default `yarn deploy` will deploy all the contracts from your `packages/hardhat/contracts` folder to the local network. You can change `defaultNetwork` in:

```sh
packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">
```

By default `yarn deploy` will deploy all the contracts from your `packages/foundry/contracts` folder to the local network. You can change `defaultNetwork` in:

```sh
packages/foundry/foundry.toml
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3.1 Deploy specific contracts

To deploy specific contracts instead of all of them, you can follow these steps:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="dev-tool">
<TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat" default>
```

1. Add tags to the deploy scripts located in `packages/hardhat/deploy`.

```ts
deployMyContract.tags = ["tagExample"];
```

2. Run `yarn deploy --tags tagExample` to run all the scripts with the "tagExample" tag.

`````mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">

1. Each contract that you wish to deploy individually should have its own deployment script in `packages/foundry/script`. For example: `DeployMyContract.s.sol`

2. Run the specific deployment script using:

```sh
yarn deploy --file DeployMyContract.s.sol
```
If you don't specify the `--file` parameter, the deployment will use the default `Deploy.s.sol` file. This default file can be configured to deploy multiple contracts in a specific order when you run the `yarn deploy` command.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3.2 Deploy to specific networks

Run the command below to deploy the smart contracts to the target network. Make sure to have your encryption password and some funds in your deployer account to pay for the transaction.

```
yarn deploy --network network_name
```

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="dev-tool">
<TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat" default>
```

You can also specify a tag:

```sh
yarn deploy --network sepolia --tags tagExample
```

````mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">

Requires custom keystore setup, see [generate accounts](#2-generate-a-new-account-or-add-one-to-deploy-the-contracts-from)

You can also specify a file:

```sh
yarn deploy --network sepolia --file DeployMyContract.s.sol
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## 4. Verify your smart contract

You can verify your smart contract on Etherscan by running:

```
yarn verify --network network_name
```

eg: `yarn verify --network sepolia`

This command **works in both Hardhat and Foundry**, verifying all the deployed contracts. However, the verification method differs depending on the Solidity framework you're using...

<Tabs groupId="dev-tool">
<TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat" default>

Hardhat uses [etherscan-verify from hardhat-deploy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-deploy#4-hardhat-etherscan-verify).

Additionally, **in Hardhat**, there's an alternative method for contract verification. You can use [hardhat-verify](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-verify) to verify your contracts, passing in the network name, contract address and constructor arguments (if any):

```sh
yarn hardhat-verify --network network_name contract_address "Constructor arg 1"`
```

If the chain you're using is not supported by any of the verifying methods, you can add new supported chains to your chosen method, either [etherscan-verify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-deploy#options-2) or [hardhat-verify](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-verify#adding-support-for-other-networks).

<TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">

Foundry uses `VerifyAll.s.sol` script located in `packages/foundry/script`.

## Configuration of Third-Party Services for Production-Grade Apps.

By default, Scaffold-ETH 2 provides predefined API keys for popular services such as Alchemy and Etherscan. This allows you to begin developing and testing your applications more easily, avoiding the need to register for these services.

For production-grade applications, it's recommended to obtain your own API keys (to prevent rate limiting issues). You can configure these at:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="dev-tool">
<TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat" default>
```

- `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` variable in `packages/hardhat/.env` and `packages/nextjs/.env.local`. You can create API keys from the [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).
- `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` variable in `packages/hardhat/.env` using your generated API key. You can get your key [here](https://etherscan.io/myapikey).

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">
```

- `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` variable in `packages/nextjs/.env.local`. You can create API keys from the [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).
- `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` variable in `packages/foundry/.env` using your generated API key. You can get your key [here](https://etherscan.io/myapikey).

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

:::tip Hint
It's recommended to store envs for nextjs in Vercel/system env config for live apps and use .env.local for local testing.
