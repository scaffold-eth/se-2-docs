# Deploy Your NextJS App

Deploy to Vercel or IPFS.

## Deploy to Vercel

:::tip Hint
We recommend connecting your GitHub repo to Vercel (through the Vercel UI) so it gets automatically deployed when pushing to `main`.
:::tip Hint

If you want to deploy directly from the CLI, run this and follow the steps to deploy to Vercel:

```
yarn vercel
```

You might need to log in to Vercel first by running:

```
yarn vercel:login
```

Once you log in (email, GitHub, etc), the default options should work. It'll give you a public URL.

If you want to redeploy to the same production URL you can run:

```
yarn vercel --prod
```

:::info Info
If you want to deploy without checking types, you can run:

```
yarn vercel:yolo --prod
```

:::info Info

If you omit the `--prod` flag it will deploy it to a preview/test URL.

**Make sure to check the values of your Scaffold Configuration before deploying your NextJS App.**

## Deploy to IPFS

You can also deploy your app to [BG IPFS](https://www.bgipfs.com/) by running:

```
yarn ipfs
```

This will build your app and deploy it to BG IPFS. After deployment, you'll receive a URL where your app is accessible.

## Scaffold App Configuration

You can configure different settings for your dapp at `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

```ts
export type ScaffoldConfig = {
  targetNetworks: Chain[];
  pollingInterval: number;
  alchemyApiKey: string;
  walletConnectProjectId: string;
  onlyLocalBurnerWallet: boolean;
  walletAutoConnect: boolean;
  // your dapp custom config, eg:
  // tokenIcon : string;
};
```

The configuration parameters are described below. Make sure to update the values according to your needs:

#### - targetNetworks

Array of blockchain networks where your dapp is deployed. Use values that are present on chains object from [viem/chains](https://viem.sh/docs/chains/introduction) eg: `targetNetworks: [chains.optimism]`

To add a custom chain that's not in viem/chains, see the recipe, [Add a custom chain](/recipes/add-custom-chain).

#### - pollingInterval

The interval in milliseconds at which your front-end application polls the RPC servers for fresh data. _Note that this setting does not affect the local network._

#### - alchemyApiKey

Default Alchemy API key from Scaffold-ETH 2 for local testing purposes.
It's recommended to obtain your own API key from the [Alchemy Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/) and store it in this environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY` in the `\packages\nextjs\.env.local` file.

#### - walletConnectProjectId

WalletConnect's default project ID from Scaffold-ETH 2 for local testing purposes.
It's recommended to obtain your own project ID from the [WalletConnect website](https://cloud.walletconnect.com) and store it in this environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID` in the `\packages\nextjs\.env.local` file.

#### - onlyLocalBurnerWallet

Controls the networks where the Burner Wallet feature is available. This feature provides a lightweight wallet for users.

- `true` => Use Burner Wallet only on Hardhat network.
- `false` => Use Burner Wallet on all networks.

#### - walletAutoConnect

Set it to `true` to activate automatic wallet connection behavior:

- If the user was connected into a wallet before, on page reload it reconnects automatically.
- If the user is not connected to any wallet, on reload, it connects to the burner wallet _if it is enabled for the current network_. See `onlyLocalBurnerWallet`

You can extend this configuration file, adding new parameters that you need to use across your dapp **(make sure you update the above type `ScaffoldConfig`)**:

```ts
  tokenIcon: "💎",
```

To use the values from the `ScaffoldConfig` in any other file of your application, you first need to import it in those files:

```ts
import scaffoldConfig from "~~/scaffold.config";
```
