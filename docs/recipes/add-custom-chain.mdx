# Add a custom chain

This recipe demonstrates how to add a custom chain to your project. We'll use Base as an example, but you can apply this process to any other chain you want to add.
Scaffold-ETH 2 uses [viem/chains](https://viem.sh/docs/chains/introduction) as a list of chains.
Normally, Base already exists in viem/chains and [you can import it and use it](/deploying/deploy-nextjs-app#--targetnetworks), but we're going to add it manually to show you how to do it.

:::info
Scaffold-ETH 2 consists of two parts:

- `packages/nextjs`: nextjs frontend
- `packages/hardhat` or `packages/foundry`: hardhat or foundry to deploy smart contracts

The frontend and the hardhat/foundry project use a different set of chains.
You should add the chain to both the frontend and your hardhat/foundry config. Checkout [deploying your smart contract](/deploying/deploy-smart-contracts) section on how to deploy different chains.

By doing this, you will be able to deploy the contracts to the chain you added and interact with them from the frontend.

### Step 1: Define the chain

First, create a new file called `customChains.ts` in your `packages/nextjs/utils/` directory.

Open the file with your favorite editor and add the following code to define the chain.

```typescript title="packages/nextjs/utils/customChains.ts"
import { defineChain } from "viem";

// Base chain
export const base = defineChain({
  id: 8453,
  name: "Base",
  nativeCurrency: { name: "Base", symbol: "ETH", decimals: 18 },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ["https://mainnet.base.org"],
    },
  },
  blockExplorers: {
    default: {
      name: "Basescan",
      url: "https://basescan.org",
    },
  },
});
```

In this file, we're defining the Base chain. We're using the `defineChain` function from viem to define the chain. You can add as many chains as you want to the `customChains.ts` file.

### Step 2: Update `scaffold.config.ts`

Next, update your `scaffold.config.ts` file to include the new chain:

```typescript title="packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts"
import { base } from "./utils/customChains";
// ... other imports and type definitions

const scaffoldConfig = {
  targetNetworks: [base],
  // ... other configuration options
} as const satisfies ScaffoldConfig;

export default scaffoldConfig;
```

If you'd like to add multiple chains, you can do so by adding them to the `targetNetworks` array. Below is a simple example of how to add multiple chains.

```typescript title="packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts"
import { base, baseSepolia } from "./utils/customChains";

const scaffoldConfig = {
  targetNetworks: [base, baseSepolia],
  // ... other configuration options
} as const satisfies ScaffoldConfig;
```
