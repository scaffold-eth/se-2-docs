# RainbowKitCustomConnectButton

Scaffold-ETH 2 uses a custom _"Connect Button"_, based on RainbowKit, that is enhanced with several useful features:

- **Balance Display**: Shows the balance of the native token from the connected address.
- **Chain Name and Color**: Displays the name of the connected blockchain and uses a distinct color for each chain.
- **Custom Modal**: Includes copy address feature, view its QR code, access address details in blockexplorer, and disconnect.

You can extend this component to suit your app's needs.
