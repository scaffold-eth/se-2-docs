# Address

Display an address (or ENS) along with a utility icon to copy the address. If the address is associated with an ENS that has an avatar, this avatar will be displayed. If not, a blockie image representation of the address will be shown.

By default, the component will show the ENS name (if available) and the address.

![Ens And Address Example](/img/AddressFull.png)

You can also choose to display only the ENS name (if available) or the address, by setting the `onlyEnsOrAddress` prop to `true`.

![Only Ens Or Address Example](/img/AddressOnlyEnsOrAddress.png)

Clicking on the address redirects to the connected wallet's network block explorer. If the wallet is not connected, it redirects to the block explorer of [`targetNetworks[0]`](/deploying/deploy-nextjs-app#--targetnetworks). You can disable this behaviour with the `disableAddressLink` prop.

## Import

```tsx
import { Address } from "~~/components/scaffold-eth";
```

## Usage

```tsx
<Address address="0x34aA3F359A9D614239015126635CE7732c18fDF3" />
```
