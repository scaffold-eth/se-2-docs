# Address

Display an address (or ENS) along with a utility icon to copy the address. If the address is associated with an ENS that has an avatar, this avatar will be displayed. If not, a blockie image representation of the address will be shown.

By default, clicking on the address redirects to the connected wallet's network block explorer. If the wallet is not connected, it redirects to the block explorer of [`targetNetworks[0]`](/deploying/deploy-nextjs-app#--targetnetworks).
