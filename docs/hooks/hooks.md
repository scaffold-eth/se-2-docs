# ðŸ›  Interacting with your Smart Contracts

Scaffold-ETH 2 provides a collection of custom React hooks designed to simplify interactions with your deployed smart contracts. These hooks are wrappers around `wagmi`, automatically loading the necessary contract ABI and address. These hooks offer a simplified and streamlined interface for interacting with your smart contracts.

If you need to interact with external contracts, you can use `wagmi` directly, or add external contract data to your `deployedContracts.ts` file.
