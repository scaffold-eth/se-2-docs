# useScaffoldContractWrite

Use this hook to send a transaction to your smart contract to write data or perform an action.

```ts
const { writeAsync, isLoading, isMining } = useScaffoldContractWrite({
  contractName: "YourContract",
  functionName: "setGreeting",
  args: ["The value to set"],
  // For payable functions, expressed in ETH
  value: "0.01",
  // The number of block confirmations to wait for before considering transaction to be confirmed (default : 1).
  blockConfirmations: 1,
  // The callback function to execute when the transaction is confirmed.
  onBlockConfirmation: txnReceipt => {
    console.log("Transaction blockHash", txnReceipt.blockHash);
  },
});
```

To send the transaction, you can call the `writeAsync` function returned by the hook. Here's an example usage:

```ts
<button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={() => writeAsync()}>
  Send TX
</button>
```

This example sends a transaction to the `YourContract` smart contract to call the `setGreeting` function with the arguments passed in `args`. The `writeAsync` function sends the transaction to the smart contract, and the `isLoading` and `isMining` properties indicate whether the transaction is currently being processed by the network.
