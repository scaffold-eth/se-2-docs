# useScaffoldContractRead

Use this hook to read public variables and get data from read-only functions of your smart contract.

```ts
const { data: totalCounter } = useScaffoldContractRead({
  contractName: "YourContract",
  functionName: "userGreetingCounter",
  args: ["0xd8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045"],
});
```

This example retrieves the data returned by the `userGreetingCounter` function of the `YourContract` smart contract.
