# Scaffold-ETH 2

Everything you need to build dApps on Ethereum. A modern, clean version of Scaffold-ETH with NextJS, RainbowKit, Wagmi and Typescript. Supports Hardhat and Foundry.

## High level overview

### Smart Contract Read and Write Operations Patterns

- Read: useScaffoldReadContract (packages/nextjs/hooks/scaffold-eth/useScaffoldReadContract.ts)
- Write: useScaffoldWriteContract (packages/nextjs/hooks/scaffold-eth/useScaffoldWriteContract.ts)
- Event Listening: useScaffoldEventHistory for historical data (packages/nextjs/hooks/scaffold-eth/useScaffoldEventHistory.ts)

You have all the details of our custom hooks in `## Hooks` section from this file.

### Best Practice Guidance for Components usage

Use Scaffold-ETH 2 components whenever it makes sense, they are located in `packages/nextjs/components/scaffold-eth`. You have all the details about components in `## components` section from this file.

### UI/Design System

Styling Framework:

- Base: Tailwind CSS v3
- Components: daisyUI v4
- DaisyUI Documentation: https://daisyui.com/llms.txt
- Implementation:
  * Core theme configuration: packages/nextjs/tailwind.config.js
  * Base styling: packages/nextjs/styles/globals.css
  * Component-specific styling in individual component files

### Wallet Connection

- Supported: RainbowKit (packages/nextjs/providers/RainbowKitProvider.tsx)

### Deployment Configuration and Network Setup

- Default chains: check if `viem/chains` already has the chain present if not, follow the below steps.
- Chains: Can be defined directly in scaffold.config.ts or in a separate file (e.g., packages/nextjs/utils/customChains.ts)
- Targets: Configured in packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts via the targetNetworks array
- RPC: Can be hardcoded in chain definitions or configured via .env.local

Example Chain Config:
// In scaffold.config.ts or a separate file
export const lineaSepolia = defineChain({
  id: 59_141,
  name: "Linea Sepolia Testnet",
  nativeCurrency: { name: "Linea Ether", symbol: "ETH", decimals: 18 },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ["https://rpc.sepolia.linea.build"],
      webSocket: ["wss://rpc.sepolia.linea.build"], // WebSocket is optional but recommended
    },
  },
  blockExplorers: {
    default: {
      name: "Etherscan",
      url: "https://sepolia.lineascan.build",
      apiUrl: "https://api-sepolia.lineascan.build/api",
    },
  },
  contracts: {
    multicall3: {
      address: "0xca11bde05977b3631167028862be2a173976ca11",
      blockCreated: 227427,
    },
  },
  testnet: true,
});

#### ✅ Disabling Type and Linting Error Checks

:::tip Hint
TypeScript helps you catch errors at compile time, which can save time and improve code quality, but can be challenging for those who are new to the language or who are used to the more dynamic nature of JavaScript. These sections show the steps required to disable type & lint checks on different levels.
:::tip Hint

#### Disabling Commit Checks

We run the `pre-commit` [git hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) which lints the staged files and doesn't let you commit if there is an linting error.

To disable this, go to the `.husky/pre-commit` file and comment out `yarn lint-staged --verbose`

```diff
- yarn lint-staged --verbose
+ # yarn lint-staged --verbose
```

#### Deploying to Vercel Without Any Checks

By default, Vercel runs type and lint checks before building your app. The deployment will fail if there are any type or lint errors.

To ignore these checks while deploying from the CLI, use:

```shell
yarn vercel:yolo
```

If your repo is connected to Vercel, you can set `NEXT_PUBLIC_IGNORE_BUILD_ERROR` to `true` in an [environment variable](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables).

#### Disabling GitHub Workflow

We have a GitHub workflow setup checkout `.github/workflows/lint.yaml` which runs type and lint error checks every time code is **pushed** to `main` branch or **pull request** is made to `main` branch.

To disable it, **delete `.github` directory**.

## Components

Scaffold-ETH 2 provides a set of pre-built components for common web3 use cases. You can make use of them to accelerate and simplify your dapp development.

### Address

Source: https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/components/Address

Display an address (or ENS) along with a utility icon to copy the address. If the address is associated with an ENS that has an avatar, this avatar will be displayed. If not, a blockie image representation of the address will be shown.

By default, the component will show the ENS name (if available) and the address.

![Ens And Address Example](/img/AddressFull.png)

You can also choose to display only the ENS name (if available) or the address, by setting the `onlyEnsOrAddress` prop to `true`.

![Only Ens Or Address Example](/img/AddressOnlyEnsOrAddress.png)

Clicking on the address redirects to the connected wallet's network block explorer. If the wallet is not connected, it redirects to the block explorer of [`targetNetworks[0]`](/deploying/deploy-nextjs-app#--targetnetworks). You can disable this behaviour with the `disableAddressLink` prop.

#### Import

```tsx
import { Address } from "~~/components/scaffold-eth";
```

#### Usage

```tsx
<Address address="0x34aA3F359A9D614239015126635CE7732c18fDF3" />
```

#### Props

## Deploying

Learn how to deploy your Smart Contracts to a Live Network and how to deploy your NextJS App.

### deploy-nextjs-app

Source: https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/deploying/deploy-nextjs-app

#### Deploy Your NextJS App

:::tip Hint
We recommend connecting your GitHub repo to Vercel (through the Vercel UI) so it gets automatically deployed when pushing to `main`.
:::tip Hint

If you want to deploy directly from the CLI, run this and follow the steps to deploy to Vercel:

```
yarn vercel
```

You might need to log in to Vercel first by running:

```
yarn vercel:login
```

Once you log in (email, GitHub, etc), the default options should work. It'll give you a public URL.

If you want to redeploy to the same production URL you can run:

```
yarn vercel --prod
```

If you omit the `--prod` flag it will deploy it to a preview/test URL.

**Make sure to check the values of your Scaffold Configuration before deploying your NextJS App.**

#### Scaffold App Configuration

You can configure different settings for your dapp at `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.

```ts
export type ScaffoldConfig = {
  targetNetworks: Chain[];
  pollingInterval: number;
  alchemyApiKey: string;
  walletConnectProjectId: string;
  onlyLocalBurnerWallet: boolean;
  walletAutoConnect: boolean;
  // your dapp custom config, eg:
  // tokenIcon : string;
};
```

The configuration parameters are described below. Make sure to update the values according to your needs:

##### - targetNetworks

Array of blockchain networks where your dapp is deployed. Use values that are present on chains object from [viem/chains](https://viem.sh/docs/chains/introduction) eg: `targetNetworks: [chains.optimism]`

To add a custom chain that's not in viem/chains, see the recipe, [Add a custom chain](/recipes/add-custom-chain).

##### - pollingInterval

The interval in milliseconds at which your front-end application polls the RPC servers for fresh data. _Note that this setting does not affect the local network._

##### - alchemyApiKey

Default Alchemy API key from Scaffold-ETH 2 for local testing purposes.
It's recommended to obtain your own API key from the [Alchemy Dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/) and store it in this environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_API_KEY` in the `\packages\nextjs\.env.local` file.

##### - walletConnectProjectId

WalletConnect's default project ID from Scaffold-ETH 2 for local testing purposes.
It's recommended to obtain your own project ID from the [WalletConnect website](https://cloud.walletconnect.com) and store it in this environment variable: `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID` in the `\packages\nextjs\.env.local` file.

##### - onlyLocalBurnerWallet

Controls the networks where the Burner Wallet feature is available. This feature provides a lightweight wallet for users.

- `true` => Use Burner Wallet only on Hardhat network.
- `false` => Use Burner Wallet on all networks.

##### - walletAutoConnect

Set it to `true` to activate automatic wallet connection behavior:

- If the user was connected into a wallet before, on page reload it reconnects automatically.
- If the user is not connected to any wallet, on reload, it connects to the burner wallet _if it is enabled for the current network_. See `onlyLocalBurnerWallet`

You can extend this configuration file, adding new parameters that you need to use across your dapp **(make sure you update the above type `ScaffoldConfig`)**:

```ts
  tokenIcon: "💎",
```

To use the values from the `ScaffoldConfig` in any other file of your application, you first need to import it in those files:

```ts
import scaffoldConfig from "~~/scaffold.config";
```

### deploy-smart-contracts

Source: https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/deploying/deploy-smart-contracts

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

#### Deploy Your Smart Contracts

To deploy your smart contracts to a live network, there are a few things you need to adjust.

#### 1. Configure your network

Scaffold-ETH 2 comes with a selection of predefined networks. To add your custom network:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="dev-tool">
<TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat" default>
```

Go to `packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts` and add your network to the `networks` object.

```typescript title="packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts"
networks: {
    // ... other networks
    base: {
        url: "https://mainnet.base.org",
        accounts: [deployerPrivateKey]
    },
}
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">
```

Go to `packages/foundry/foundry.toml` and add your network to the `rpc_endpoints` object.

```toml title="packages/foundry/foundry.toml"
[rpc_endpoints]
...other chains
base = "https://mainnet.base.org"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Here are the [Alchemy docs](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-add-alchemy-rpc-endpoints-to-metamask) for information on specific networks.

You can also add your custom network by following the recipe [here](/recipes/add-custom-chain).

#### 2. Generate a new account or add one to deploy the contract(s) from.

The deployer account is the account that will deploy your contracts. Additionally, the deployer account will be used to execute any function calls that are part of your deployment script.

You can generate a random account / private key by running:

```
yarn generate
```

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="dev-tool">
<TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat" default>
```

It will automatically add the encrypted private key (`DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY_ENCRYPTED`) in your `.env` file.

You will be prompted to enter a password which will be used to encrypt your private key. **Make sure to remember this password as you'll need it for future deployments and account queries.**

:::info Info
We are only storing the plain private key in memory, it's never stored in disk files for security reasons. Checkout the code [here](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/create-eth/blob/main/templates/solidity-frameworks/hardhat/packages/hardhat/scripts/generateAccount.ts).
:::info

If you prefer to import your private key, run:

```
yarn account:import
```

You will get prompted to paste your private key and set the encryption password. It will store your encrypted private key in your `.env` file.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">
```

It will automatically generate a new [keystore](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cli/cast/wallet#cast-wallet) with the name `scaffold-eth-custom`.

You will be prompted to enter a password which will be used to encrypt your keystore. **Make sure to remember this password as you'll need it for future deployments and account queries.**

Now you'll need to open your `packages/foundry/.env` file, and update `ETH_KEYSTORE_ACCOUNT=scaffold-eth-custom` to start using the new keystore.

If you prefer to import your private key (you need to delete your `scaffold-eth-custom` keystore first, if exists), run:

```
yarn account:import
```

You will get prompted to paste your private key and set the encryption password. It will store your encrypted private key in the `scaffold-eth-custom` keystore file.

Also if you want to use your existing keystore account you can just update the `ETH_KEYSTORE_ACCOUNT` in your `.env` file, setting the name of your existing keystore.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can check the configured (generated or imported) account and balances with:

```
yarn account
```

You will need to enter your password to decrypt the private key and view the account information and balances.

#### 3. Deploy your smart contract(s)

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="dev-tool">
<TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat" default>
```

By default `yarn deploy` will deploy all the contracts from your `packages/hardhat/contracts` folder to the local network. You can change `defaultNetwork` in:

```sh
packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">
```

By default `yarn deploy` will deploy all the contracts from your `packages/foundry/contracts` folder to the local network. You can change `defaultNetwork` in:

```sh
packages/foundry/foundry.toml
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### 3.1 Deploy specific contracts

To deploy specific contracts instead of all of them, you can follow these steps:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="dev-tool">
<TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat" default>
```

1. Add tags to the deploy scripts located in `packages/hardhat/deploy`. For example `01_deploy_my_contract.ts`:

```ts
deployMyContract.tags = ["tagExample"];
```

2. Run `yarn deploy --tags tagExample` to run all the scripts with the "tagExample" tag.

`````mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">

1. Each contract that you wish to deploy individually should have its own deployment script in `packages/foundry/script`. For example: `DeployMyContract.s.sol`

2. Run the specific deployment script using:

```sh
yarn deploy --file DeployMyContract.s.sol
```
If you don't specify the `--file` parameter, the deployment will use the default `Deploy.s.sol` file. This default file can be configured to deploy multiple contracts in a specific order when you run the `yarn deploy` command.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### 3.2 Deploy to specific networks

Run the command below to deploy the smart contracts to the target network. Make sure to have your encryption password and some funds in your deployer account to pay for the transaction.

```
yarn deploy --network network_name
```

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="dev-tool">
<TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat" default>
```

You can also specify a tag:

```sh
yarn deploy --network sepolia --tags tagExample
```

````mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">

Requires custom keystore setup, see [generate accounts](#2-generate-a-new-account-or-add-one-to-deploy-the-contracts-from)

You can also specify a file:

```sh
yarn deploy --network sepolia --file DeployMyContract.s.sol
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### 4. Verify your smart contract

You can verify your smart contract on Etherscan by running:

```
yarn verify --network network_name
```

eg: `yarn verify --network sepolia`

This command **works in both Hardhat and Foundry**, verifying all the deployed contracts. However, the verification method differs depending on the Solidity framework you're using...

<Tabs groupId="dev-tool">
<TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat" default>

Hardhat uses [etherscan-verify from hardhat-deploy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-deploy#4-hardhat-etherscan-verify).

Additionally, **in Hardhat**, there's an alternative method for contract verification. You can use [hardhat-verify](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-verify) to verify your contracts, passing in the network name, contract address and constructor arguments (if any):

```sh
yarn hardhat-verify --network network_name contract_address "Constructor arg 1"`
```

If the chain you're using is not supported by any of the verifying methods, you can add new supported chains to your chosen method, either [etherscan-verify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hardhat-deploy#options-2) or [hardhat-verify](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-verify#adding-support-for-other-networks).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">

Foundry uses `VerifyAll.s.sol` script located in `packages/foundry/script`.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Configuration of Third-Party Services for Production-Grade Apps.

By default, Scaffold-ETH 2 provides predefined API keys for popular services such as Alchemy and Etherscan. This allows you to begin developing and testing your applications more easily, avoiding the need to register for these services.

For production-grade applications, it's recommended to obtain your own API keys (to prevent rate limiting issues). You can configure these at:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="dev-tool">
<TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat" default>
```

- `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` variable in `packages/hardhat/.env` and `packages/nextjs/.env.local`. You can create API keys from the [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).
- `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` variable in `packages/hardhat/.env` using your generated API key. You can get your key [here](https://etherscan.io/myapikey).

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">
```

- `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` variable in `packages/nextjs/.env.local`. You can create API keys from the [Alchemy dashboard](https://dashboard.alchemy.com/).
- `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` variable in `packages/foundry/.env` using your generated API key. You can get your key [here](https://etherscan.io/myapikey).

```mdx-code-block

## Extensions

Extensions are modular add-ons for Scaffold-ETH 2 that provide additional functionality or serve as examples for specific features. They allow you to quickly add new features, pages, contracts, or components during project creation, ensuring seamless integration with Scaffold-ETH 2 core functionality.

### createExtensions

Source: https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/extensions/createExtensions

#### Creating Your Own Extension

This section will help you develop custom extensions for Scaffold-ETH 2, from simple additions to more complex modifications.

> Video Guide: For a visual walkthrough of the extension development process, check out our [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/XQCv533XGZk?si=dlJH4zd4b99_6soW).

#### Extension Structure

Before diving into the development process, let's understand the structure an extension should follow:

```
your-extension/
├── extension/
│   ├── packages/
│   │   ├── hardhat/        # (optional) For Hardhat-specific additions
│   │   ├── foundry/        # (optional) For Foundry-specific additions
│   │   └── nextjs/
│   │       ├── app/        # Any new pages/files
│   │       │   └── my-page
│   │       │       ├── page.tsx
│   │       │
│   │       ├── ...         # Any extra files/directories
│   │       └── package.json  # Only include additional dependencies/scripts
│   ├── package.json        # Monorepo root package.json file
│   └── README.md           # Instance README
└── README.md               # Documentation for your extension
```

#### Developing a Simple Extension

For simple extensions, such as adding a new page or component, you can directly create the extension structure without going through the full development workflow. Here's how:

1. Create the directory structure as shown above.
2. Add your new page or component in the appropriate directory.
3. If needed, create a `package.json` with any additional dependencies.
4. Push your extension to GitHub.

That's it! Your simple extension is ready to be used by others via:

```shell
npx create-eth@latest -e {github-username}/{extension-repo-name}:{branch-name} # branch-name is optional
```

#### Developing an Advanced Extension

#### Template Files and Args

`create-eth` uses a templating system for advanced extensions that need to modify existing files. This system allows you to inject content into specific files in the base project using the `*.args.mjs` files.

Key points:

- They allow you to add specific content to files in the base project.
- Not all files can be modified this way. See [TEMPLATE-FILES.md](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/create-eth/blob/main/contributors/TEMPLATE-FILES.md) for a list of supported template files.
- To use a template file, create an `*.args.mjs` file in your extension having the same path structure as `*.template.mjs`. For example, to add extra tab in the header, you'd create `extension/packages/nextjs/components/Header.tsx.args.mjs`.

#### Advanced Development Workflow

When creating complex extensions, Scaffold-ETH 2 provides a set of tools to make the process easier. This workflow allows you to develop your extension in a full Scaffold-ETH 2 environment, test it locally, and then package it for distribution.

The workflow consists of two main parts:

1. Extension Development: This process helps you create your extension by modifying a base Scaffold-ETH 2 project.

2. Local Testing: This allows you to test your extension in a full Scaffold-ETH 2 environment before publishing.

#### Extension Development Utility

1. **Clone the `create-eth` Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/create-eth.git
   cd create-eth
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Run the Build Script:**

   ```bash
   yarn build:dev
   ```

   This creates `cli.js` and `create-extension.js` in the `dist` directory.

3. **Run the CLI to Create a New Instance:**

   ```bash
   yarn cli
   ```

   This command will create a **new base instance**, similar to running `npx create-eth@latest`.

   The name mentioned for the "Your project name" question will be used as the **extension name**. For example, if you provide `eip` as the value to the question, then the final extension name will be `eip`.

4. **Develop the Extension:**

   - cd into the instance directory.
   - Make necessary changes to the instance project.
   - Commit the changes in the instance repository.

5. **Create the Extension:**

   Return to the `create-eth` folder.

   ```bash
   yarn create-extension {projectName}
   ```

   Example: `yarn create-extension eip`

   This command gathers all changes from the instance and creates an extension in the `create-eth/externalExtensions/${extensionName}` directory. This directory is the actual extension directory (notice it contains only extra files related to your extension changes), which can be published to GitHub and used by others.

6. **Publish the Extension:**

   - Go inside the extension directory.
   - Push the extension to GitHub.

   ```bash
   cd create-eth/externalExtensions/${extensionName}
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit of my extension"
   git remote add origin <remote-repo-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   Now other developers can use your published extension by using:

   ```bash
   npx create-eth@latest -e {github-username}/{extension-repo-name}:{branch-name} # extension-branch-name is optional
   ```

#### Local Testing:

This phase allows you to test your extension locally and see how it works when used by other developers.

> NOTE: If you've already published your extension to GitHub using the "Developing a Simple Extension" approach, make sure to clone that extension repository into the `create-eth/externalExtensions/` directory before proceeding with local testing.

1. **Run the CLI in dev mode:**

   ```bash
   yarn cli -e {extensionName} --dev
   ```

   Example: `yarn cli -e eip --dev`

   The `extensionName` should be present in `create-eth/externalExtensions/${extensionName}`.

   Let's suppose you named your project "my-dev-instance". Then this `my-dev-instance` should contain all your extension changes. `--dev` will symlink the extension to the instance project.

2. **Test and Tweak the Extension:**
   Since the instance is symlinked with the extension, make necessary changes directly in the symlinked files within `my-dev-instance`, and changes should be automatically reflected in the `create-eth/externalExtensions/${extensionName}` directory.

3. **Push the tweaked changes**

   - Go inside the extension directory.
   - Push the changes to GitHub.

   ```bash
   cd create-eth/externalExtensions/${extensionName}
   git add .
   git commit -m "some changes"
   git push
   ```

   Next time users call your extension via `npx create-eth@latest -e`, they will get the updated version.

### howToInstall

Source: https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/extensions/howToInstall

#### How to Install Extensions

This guide explains what are extensions and how to use them in your Scaffold-ETH 2 project.

#### What are Extensions?

Extensions are modular add-ons for Scaffold-ETH 2 that provide additional functionality or serve as examples for specific features.

:::info Info
Extensions can only be installed during the initial setup of a new Scaffold-ETH 2 project.
:::info Info

They offer several benefits:

- Seamless integration with the base Scaffold-ETH 2 project
- Quick addition of new features, pages, contracts, or components at project creation
- Compatibility with Scaffold-ETH 2 core updates and improvements

Extensions are compact packages containing specific code (such as a smart contract or UI component) that automatically integrate with the latest version of Scaffold-ETH 2 when initializing a new project via npx. They are starting points for your project, not finished products.

#### Installing Extensions

To install an extension when creating a new Scaffold-ETH 2 project, run:

```bash
npx create-eth@latest -e {github-username}/{extension-repo-name}:{branch-name}
```

The `{branch-name}` is optional. If not specified, it uses the default branch.

E.g.: `npx create-eth@latest -e ChangoMan/charts-extension`

#### Available Extensions

You can find a complete list of available extensions, including both curated (by BuidlGuidl) and community extensions, on [scaffold-eth website](https://scaffoldeth.io/extensions).

## External-contracts

### 📡 Interacting with External Contracts

If you need to interact with external contracts (i.e. not deployed with your SE-2 instance, e.g [`DAI`](https://etherscan.io/token/0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f#code) contract) you can add external contract data to your `packages/nextjs/contracts/externalContracts.ts` file, which would let you use Scaffold-ETH 2 [custom hooks](/hooks).

To achieve this, include the contract name, its `address`, and `abi` in `externalContracts.ts` for each chain ID. Ensure to update the [`targetNetworks`](/deploying/deploy-nextjs-app#--targetnetworks) in `scaffold.config.ts` to your preferred chains to enable hooks typescript autocompletion.

This is the structure of `externalContracts` object:

```ts
const externalContracts = {
  1: {
    DAI: {
      address: "0x...",
      abi: [...],
    },
    WETH: {
      address: "0x...",
      abi: [...],
    },
  },
  5: {
    DAI: {
      address: "0x...",
      abi: [...],
    },
    WETH: {
      address: "0x...",
      abi: [...],
    },
  },
} as const;
```

## Hooks

### 🛠 Interacting with Your Smart Contracts

Scaffold-ETH 2 provides a collection of custom React hooks designed to simplify interactions with your deployed smart contracts. These hooks are wrappers around Wagmi, an easy-to-use interface with typescript autocompletions for reading from, writing to, and monitoring events emitted by your smart contracts.

To ensure autocompletions function correctly, always update the [`targetNetworks` ](/deploying/deploy-nextjs-app#--targetnetworks) in `scaffold.config.ts` to include the relevant network/chain whenever you deploy your contract using [`yarn deploy --network`](/deploying/deploy-smart-contracts#3-deploy-your-smart-contracts).

:::info
The custom hooks rely on three main files for their functionality and TypeScript autocompletion:

- `packages/nextjs/contracts/deployedContracts.ts`
- [`packages/nextjs/contracts/externalContracts.ts`](/external-contracts)
- `scaffold.config.ts`

The `deployedContracts.ts` file is auto-generated/updated whenever you run `yarn deploy --network`. It organizes contract addresses and abi's based on chainId.

:::

:::note

When having multiple chains configured in [`targetNetworks`](/deploying/deploy-nextjs-app#--targetnetworks), make sure to have same contractName's on other chains as `targetNetworks[0].id`.This ensures proper functionality and autocompletion of custom hooks, as the current setup and types assumes that same contract's are present on other chains as `targetNetworks[0]`.

:::

### useDeployedContractInfo

Source: https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/hooks/useDeployedContractInfo

Use this hook to fetch details about a deployed smart contract, including the ABI and address.

```ts
const { data: deployedContractData } = useDeployedContractInfo({ contractName: "YourContract" });
```

This example retrieves the details of the deployed contract with the specified name and stores the details in the `deployedContractData` object.

#### Configuration

| Parameter              | Type     | Description                                                                                                                |
| :--------------------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **contractName**       | `string` | Name of the contract.                                                                                                      |
| **chainId** (optional) | `string` | Id of the chain the contract lives on. Defaults to [`targetNetworks[0].id`](/deploying/deploy-nextjs-app#--targetnetworks) |

#### Return Value

- `data`: Object containing `address` and `abi` of contract.

### useScaffoldContract

Source: https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/hooks/useScaffoldContract

Use this hook to get your contract instance by providing the contract name. It enables you to interact with your contract methods.
For reading data or sending transactions, it's recommended to use `useScaffoldReadContract` and `useScaffoldWriteContract`.

```ts
const { data: yourContract } = useScaffoldContract({
  contractName: "YourContract",
});
// Returns the greeting and can be called in any function, unlike useScaffoldReadContract
await yourContract?.read.greeting();

// Used to write to a contract and can be called in any function
import { useWalletClient } from "wagmi";

const { data: walletClient } = useWalletClient();
const { data: yourContract } = useScaffoldContract({
  contractName: "YourContract",
  chainId: 31337,
  walletClient,
});
const setGreeting = async () => {
  // Call the method in any function
  await yourContract?.write.setGreeting(["the greeting here"]);
};
```

This example uses the `useScaffoldContract` hook to obtain a contract instance for the `YourContract` smart contract.

#### Configuration

| Parameter                   | Type                                                               | Description                                                                                                                |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **contractName**            | `string`                                                           | Name of the contract.                                                                                                      |
| **walletClient** (optional) | [`WalletClient`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useWalletClient) | Wallet client must be passed in order to call `write` methods of the contract                                              |
| **chainId** (optional)      | `string`                                                           | Id of the chain the contract lives on. Defaults to [`targetNetworks[0].id`](/deploying/deploy-nextjs-app#--targetnetworks) |

#### Return Value

- `data` : Object representing viem's [contract instance](https://viem.sh/docs/contract/getContract.html#return-value). Which can be used to call `read` and `write` of the contract.

- `isLoading` : Boolean indicating if the contract is being loaded.

### useScaffoldEventHistory

Source: https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/hooks/useScaffoldEventHistory

Use this hook to retrieve historical event logs for your smart contract, providing past activity data, with the option to watch for new events.

```ts
const {
  data: events,
  isLoading: isLoadingEvents,
  error: errorReadingEvents,
} = useScaffoldEventHistory({
  contractName: "YourContract",
  eventName: "GreetingChange",
  fromBlock: 31231n,
  watch: true,
  filters: { greetingSetter: "0x9eB2C4866aAe575bC88d00DE5061d5063a1bb3aF" },
  blockData: true,
  transactionData: true,
  receiptData: true,
});
```

This example retrieves the historical event logs for the `GreetingChange` event of the `YourContract` smart contract, starting from block number 31231 and filtering events where the `greetingSetter` parameter is `0x9eB2C4866aAe575bC88d00DE5061d5063a1bb3aF`.

#### Configuration

| Parameter                      | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| :----------------------------- | :-------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **contractName**               | `string`  | Name of the contract to read from.                                                                                                                                    |
| **eventName**                  | `string`  | Name of the event to read.                                                                                                                                            |

### useScaffoldWatchContractEvent

Source: https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/hooks/useScaffoldWatchContractEvent

Use this hook to subscribe to events emitted by your smart contract, and receive real-time updates when these events are emitted.

```ts
useScaffoldWatchContractEvent({
  contractName: "YourContract",
  eventName: "GreetingChange",
  // The onLogs function is called whenever a GreetingChange event is emitted by the contract.
  // Parameters emitted by the event can be destructed using the below example
  // for this example: event GreetingChange(address greetingSetter, string newGreeting, bool premium, uint256 value);
  onLogs: logs => {
    logs.map(log => {
      const { greetingSetter, value, premium, newGreeting } = log.args;
      console.log("📡 GreetingChange event", greetingSetter, value, premium, newGreeting);
    });
  },
});
```

This example subscribes to the `GreetingChange` event emitted by the `YourContract` smart contract and logs the parameters from the event to the console when it's emitted.

This hook is a wrapper around wagmi's [useWatchContractEvent](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useWatchContractEvent).

:::note
Due to shortcomings of some RPC providers, this hook may or may not fire events always [checkout this discussion](https://github.com/wevm/wagmi/issues/3883) for more details. To update the RPC link checkout [this section](/deploying/deploy-nextjs-app#--alchemyapikey)

### useScaffoldWriteContract

Source: https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/hooks/useScaffoldWriteContract

Use this hook to send a transaction to your smart contract to write data or perform an action.

```ts
const { writeContractAsync: writeYourContractAsync } = useScaffoldWriteContract({ contractName: "YourContract" });
```

The following configuration options can be passed to the hook:

#### Configuration

| Parameter                          | Type     | Description                                                                                                                |
| :--------------------------------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **contractName**                   | `string` | Name of the contract to write to.                                                                                          |
| **chainId** (optional)             | `string` | Id of the chain the contract lives on. Defaults to [`targetNetworks[0].id`](/deploying/deploy-nextjs-app#--targetnetworks) |
| **writeContractParams** (optional) | `object` | wagmi's `useWriteContract` hook [parameters object](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useWriteContract#parameters)          |

To send the transaction, you can call the `writeContractAsync` function returned by the hook (which we instance as `writeYourContractAsync`). Here's an example usage:

```tsx
<button
  className="btn btn-primary"
  onClick={async () => {
    try {
      await writeYourContractAsync({
        functionName: "setGreeting",
        args: ["The value to set"],
        value: parseEther("0.1"),
      });
    } catch (e) {
      console.error("Error setting greeting:", e);
    }
  }}
>
  Set Greeting
</button>
```

This example sends a transaction to the `YourContract` smart contract to call the `setGreeting` function with the arguments passed in `args`. The `writeContractAsync` function (`writeYourContractAsync` instance) sends the transaction to the smart contract.

Below is the configuration for `writeContractAsync` function:

#### Configuration

| Parameter                          | Type        | Description                                                                                                          |
| :--------------------------------- | :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **functionName**                   | `string`    | Name of the function to call.                                                                                        |
| **args** (optional)                | `unknown[]` | Array of arguments to pass to the function (if accepts any). Types are inferred from contract's function parameters. |
| **value** (optional)               | `bigint`    | Amount of ETH to send with the transaction (for payable functions only).                                             |
| **onBlockConfirmation** (optional) | `function`  | Callback function to execute when the transaction is confirmed.                                                      |
| **blockConfirmations** (optional)  | `number`    | Number of block confirmations to wait for before considering transaction to be confirmed (default : 1).              |

You can also pass other arguments accepted by [writeContractAsync from wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useWriteContract#mutate-async).

#### Return Values

- `writeContractAsync` function sends the transaction to the smart contract.
- `isMining` property indicates whether the transaction is currently being mined.
- The extended object includes properties inherited from wagmi useWriteContract. You can check the [useWriteContract return values](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useWriteContract#return-type) documentation to check the types.

### useTransactor

Source: https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/hooks/useTransactor

Use this hook to interact with the chain and give UI feedback on the transaction status.

![Transaction success](/img/transactorSuccess.gif)

Any error will instead show a popup with nice error message.

![Error Example](/img/transactorFail.gif)

```ts
const transactor = useTransactor();
const writeTx = transactor({
  to: "0x97843608a00e2bbc75ab0C1911387E002565DEDE", // address of buidlguidl.eth
  value: 1000000000000000000n,
});
await writeTx();
```

This example tries to send 1 ETH to the address `buidlguidl.eth`, prompting the connected [`WalletClient`](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useWalletClient#usewalletclient) for a signature. And in the case of a successful transaction, it will show a popup in the UI with the message: "🎉 Transaction completed successfully!".

You can pass in anything that is a valid parameter to [Viem's `sendTransaction` function](https://viem.sh/docs/actions/wallet/sendTransaction#parameters) to callback function. It also possible to pass it an promise that resolves in with a transaction hash for example promise from [Wagmi's `writeContractAsync` function](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useWriteContract#mutate-async).

[Refer to this recipe](/recipes/WriteToContractWriteAsyncButton) for a more detailed example.

## Quick-start

### environment

Source: https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/quick-start/environment

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";


Now that our installation is complete, let's configure the development environment for Scaffold ETH-2.

#### 1. **Initialize a Local Blockchain**:

In the first terminal, run a local network:

```
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat or Foundry, depending on which one you selected in the CLI. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="dev-tool">
<TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat" default>
```

```sh
packages/hardhat/hardhat.config.ts
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">
```

```sh
packages/foundry/foundry.toml
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### 2. **Deploy Your Smart Contract**:

In the second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract can be modified to suit your needs and can be found in:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="dev-tool">
<TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat" default>
```

```sh
packages/hardhat/contracts
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">
```

```sh
packages/foundry/contracts
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `yarn deploy` command uses a deploy script to deploy the contract to the network. You can customize the deployment script located in:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="dev-tool">
<TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat" default>
```

```sh
packages/hardhat/deploy
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="foundry" label="Foundry">
```

```sh
packages/foundry/script
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### 3. **Launch your NextJS Application**:

In the third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the contract component or the example ui in the frontend.

#### What's Next:

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="dev-tool">
<TabItem value="hardhat" label="Hardhat" default>
```

- Edit your smart contract:
  - `YourContract.sol` in `packages/hardhat/contracts`
- Edit your deployment scripts:
  - `packages/hardhat/deploy`
- Edit your frontend homepage at `packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx`.

## Recipes

Explore a collection of practical recipes to implement common web3 use-cases with Scaffold-ETH 2. Learn how to interact with smart contracts, read and display data, manage account balances, and more. Each recipe offers step-by-step guidance, making it easy to implement different blockchain features into your dApps.

### add-custom-chain

Source: https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/recipes/add-custom-chain

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

#### Add a custom chain

This recipe demonstrates how to add a custom chain to your project. We'll use Base as an example, but you can apply this process to any other chain you want to add.
Scaffold-ETH 2 uses [viem/chains](https://viem.sh/docs/chains/introduction) as a list of chains.
Normally, Base already exists in viem/chains and [you can import it and use it](/deploying/deploy-nextjs-app#--targetnetworks), but we're going to add it manually to show you how to do it.

:::info
Scaffold-ETH 2 consists of two parts:

- `packages/nextjs`: nextjs frontend
- `packages/hardhat` or `packages/foundry`: hardhat or foundry to deploy smart contracts

The frontend and the hardhat/foundry project use a different set of chains.
You should add the chain to both the frontend and your hardhat/foundry config. Checkout [deploying your smart contract](/deploying/deploy-smart-contracts) section on how to deploy different chains.

By doing this, you will be able to deploy the contracts to the chain you added and interact with them from the frontend.

:::

#### Step 1: Define the chain

First, create a new file called `customChains.ts` in your `packages/nextjs/utils/` directory.

Open the file with your favorite editor and add the following code to define the chain.

```typescript title="packages/nextjs/utils/customChains.ts"
import { defineChain } from "viem";

// Base chain
export const base = defineChain({
  id: 8453,
  name: "Base",
  nativeCurrency: { name: "Base", symbol: "ETH", decimals: 18 },
  rpcUrls: {
    default: {
      http: ["https://mainnet.base.org"],
    },
  },
  blockExplorers: {
    default: {
      name: "Basescan",
      url: "https://basescan.org",
    },
  },
});
```

In this file, we're defining the Base chain. We're using the `defineChain` function from viem to define the chain. You can add as many chains as you want to the `customChains.ts` file.

#### Step 2: Update `scaffold.config.ts`

Next, update your `scaffold.config.ts` file to include the new chain:

```typescript title="packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts"
import { base } from "./utils/customChains";
// ... other imports and type definitions

const scaffoldConfig = {
  targetNetworks: [base],
  // ... other configuration options
} as const satisfies ScaffoldConfig;

export default scaffoldConfig;
```

If you'd like to add multiple chains, you can do so by adding them to the `targetNetworks` array. Below is a simple example of how to add multiple chains.

```typescript title="packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts"
import { base, baseSepolia } from "./utils/customChains";

const scaffoldConfig = {
  targetNetworks: [base, baseSepolia],
  // ... other configuration options
} as const satisfies ScaffoldConfig;
```

### GetCurrentBalanceFromAccount

Source: https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/recipes/GetCurrentBalanceFromAccount

#### Get the Current Balance of the Connected Account

This recipe shows how to fetch and display the ETH balance of the currently connected account.

<details open>
<summary>Here is the full code, which we will be implementing in the guide below:</summary>

```tsx title="components/ConnectedAddressBalance.tsx"
import { useAccount } from "wagmi";
import { Address, Balance } from "~~/components/scaffold-eth";

export const ConnectedAddressBalance = () => {
  const { address: connectedAddress } = useAccount();

  return (
    <div className="bg-base-300 p-6 rounded-lg max-w-md mx-auto mt-6">
      <h2 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Your Ethereum Balance</h2>

      <div className="text-sm font-semibold mb-2">
        Address: <Address address={connectedAddress} />
      </div>

      <div className="text-sm font-semibold">
        Balance: <Balance address={connectedAddress} />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

</details>

#### Implementation guide

#### Step 1: Create a new Component

Begin by creating a new component in the "components" folder of your application.

```tsx title="components/ConnectedAddressBalance.tsx"
export const ConnectedAddressBalance = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Your Ethereum Balance</h2>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Step 2: Retrieve the Connected Account

Fetch the Ethereum address of the currently connected account using the [useAccount wagmi hook](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useAccount) and easily display them using Scaffold ETH-2 [Address](/components/Address) and [Balance](/components/Balance) components.

```tsx title="components/ConnectedAddressBalance.tsx"
// highlight-start
import { useAccount } from "wagmi";
import { Address, Balance } from "~~/components/scaffold-eth";
// highlight-end

export const ConnectedAddressBalance = () => {
  // highlight-start
  const { address: connectedAddress } = useAccount();
  // highlight-end

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Your Ethereum Balance</h2>
      {/* highlight-start */}
      Address: <Address address={connectedAddress} />
      Balance: <Balance address={connectedAddress} />
      {/* highlight-end */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### ReadUintFromContract

Source: https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/recipes/ReadUintFromContract

#### Read a `uint` from a contract

This recipe demonstrates how to read data from contract functions and display it on the UI. We'll showcase an example that accepts some arguments (parameters), and another with no arguments at all.

<details open>
<summary>Here is the full code, which we will be implementing in the guide below:</summary>

```tsx title="components/GreetingsCount.tsx"
import { useAccount } from "wagmi";
import { useScaffoldReadContract } from "~~/hooks/scaffold-eth";

export const GreetingsCount = () => {
  const { address: connectedAddress } = useAccount();

  const { data: totalCounter, isLoading: isTotalCounterLoading } = useScaffoldReadContract({
    contractName: "YourContract",
    functionName: "totalCounter",
  });

  const { data: connectedAddressCounter, isLoading: isConnectedAddressCounterLoading } = useScaffoldReadContract({
    contractName: "YourContract",
    functionName: "userGreetingCounter",
    args: [connectedAddress], // passing args to function
  });

  return (
    <div className="card card-compact w-64 bg-secondary text-primary-content shadow-xl m-4">
      <div className="card-body items-center text-center">
        <h2 className="card-title">Greetings Count</h2>
        <div className="card-actions items-center flex-col gap-1 text-lg">
          <h2 className="font-bold m-0">Total Greetings count:</h2>
          {isTotalCounterLoading ? (
            <span className="loading loading-spinner"></span>
          ) : (
            <p className="m-0">{totalCounter ? totalCounter.toString() : 0}</p>
          )}
          <h2 className="font-bold m-0">Your Greetings count:</h2>
          {isConnectedAddressCounterLoading ? (
            <span className="loading loading-spinner"></span>
          ) : (
            <p className="m-0">{connectedAddressCounter ? connectedAddressCounter.toString() : 0}</p>
          )}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

</details>

#### Implementation guide

#### Step 1: Create a new Component

Begin by creating a new component in the "components" folder of your application.

```tsx title="components/GreetingsCount.tsx"
export const GreetingsCount = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2 className="font-bold m-0">Total Greetings count:</h2>
      <h2 className="font-bold m-0">Your Greetings count:</h2>
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Step 2: Retrieve total greetings count

Initialize the [useScaffoldReadContract](/hooks/useScaffoldReadContract) hook to read from the contract. This hook provides the `data` which contains the return value of the function.

```tsx title="components/GreetingsCount.tsx"
//highlight-start
import { useScaffoldReadContract } from "~~/hooks/scaffold-eth";
// highlight-end

export const GreetingsCount = () => {
  // highlight-start
  const { data: totalCounter } = useScaffoldReadContract({
    contractName: "YourContract",
    functionName: "totalCounter",
  });
  // highlight-end

  return (
    <div>
      <h2 className="font-bold m-0">Total Greetings count:</h2>
      //highlight-start
      <p>{totalCounter ? totalCounter.toString() : 0}</p>
      //highlight-end
      <h2 className="font-bold m-0">Your Greetings count:</h2>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In the line `const {data: totalCounter} = useScaffoldReadContract({...})` we are using [destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) to assign `data` to a new name `totalCounter`.

In the contract, `totalCounter` returns an `uint` value, which is represented as a [`BigInt`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt) in javascript and can be converted to a readable string using `.toString()`.

#### Step 3: Retrieve connected address greetings count

We can get the connected address using the [useAccount](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useAccount) hook and pass it to `args` key in the `useScaffoldReadContract` hook configuration. This will be used as an argument to read the contract function.

```tsx title="components/GreetingsCount.tsx"
import { useScaffoldReadContract } from "~~/hooks/scaffold-eth";
//highlight-start
import { useAccount } from "wagmi";
//highlight-end

export const GreetingsCount = () => {
  //highlight-start
  const { address: connectedAddress } = useAccount();
  //highlight-end

  const { data: totalCounter } = useScaffoldReadContract({
    contractName: "YourContract",
    functionName: "totalCounter",
  });

  //highlight-start
  const { data: connectedAddressCounter } = useScaffoldReadContract({
    contractName: "YourContract",
    functionName: "userGreetingCounter",
    args: [connectedAddress], // passing args to function
  });
  //highlight-end

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Total Greetings count:</h2>
      <p>{totalCounter ? totalCounter.toString() : 0}</p>
      <h2>Your Greetings count:</h2>
      //highlight-start
      <p>{connectedAddressCounter ? connectedAddressCounter.toString() : 0}</p>
      //highlight-end
    </div>
  );
};
```

#### Step 4: Bonus adding loading state

We can use `isLoading` returned from the [`useScaffoldReadContract`](/hooks/usescaffoldreadcontract) hook. This variable is set to `true` while fetching data from the contract.

```tsx title="components/GreetingsCount.tsx"
import { useScaffoldReadContract } from "~~/hooks/scaffold-eth";
import { useAccount } from "wagmi";

export const GreetingsCount = () => {
  const { address: connectedAddress } = useAccount();

  // highlight-start
  const { data: totalCounter, isLoading: isTotalCounterLoading } = useScaffoldReadContract({
    // highlight-end
    contractName: "YourContract",
    functionName: "totalCounter",
  });

  // highlight-start
  const { data: connectedAddressCounter, isLoading: isConnectedAddressCounterLoading } = useScaffoldReadContract({
    // highlight-end
    contractName: "YourContract",
    functionName: "userGreetingCounter",
    args: [connectedAddress], // passing args to function
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Total Greetings count:</h2>
      // highlight-start
      {isTotalCounterLoading ? (
        <span className="loading loading-spinner"></span>
      ) : (
        <p className="m-0">{totalCounter ? totalCounter.toString() : 0}</p>
      )}
      // highlight-end
      <h2>Your Greetings count:</h2>
      // highlight-start
      {isConnectedAddressCounterLoading ? (
        <span className="loading loading-spinner"></span>
      ) : (
        <p className="m-0">{connectedAddressCounter ? connectedAddressCounter.toString() : 0}</p>
      )}
      // highlight-end
    </div>
  );
};
```

### WagmiContractWriteWithFeedback

Source: https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/recipes/WagmiContractWriteWithFeedback

#### Wagmi `useWriteContract` with transaction status

This recipe demonstrates how to create a button for contract interaction using the "useTransactor" and "useWriteContract" hooks from the "wagmi" library. The interaction includes the capability to provide feedback on the transaction status when using wagmi `useWriteContract`.

<details open>
<summary>Here is the full code, which we will be implementing in the guide below:</summary>

```tsx title="components/ContractInteraction.tsx"
import * as React from "react";
import { parseEther } from "viem";
import { useWriteContract } from "wagmi";
import DeployedContracts from "~~/contracts/deployedContracts";
import { useTransactor } from "~~/hooks/scaffold-eth";

export const ContractInteraction = () => {
  const { writeContractAsync, isPending } = useWriteContract();

  const writeContractAsyncWithParams = () =>
    writeContractAsync({
      address: DeployedContracts[31337].YourContract.address,
      abi: DeployedContracts[31337].YourContract.abi,
      functionName: "setGreeting",
      value: parseEther("0.01"),
      args: ["Hello world!"],
    });

  const writeTx = useTransactor();

  const handleSetGreeting = async () => {
    try {
      await writeTx(writeContractAsyncWithParams, { blockConfirmations: 1 });
    } catch (e) {
      console.log("Unexpected error in writeTx", e);
    }
  };

  return (
    <button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={handleSetGreeting} disabled={isPending}>
      {isPending ? <span className="loading loading-spinner loading-sm"></span> : "Send"}
    </button>
  );
};
```

</details>

#### Implementation

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Component

Create a new component in the "components" folder. The component will show a button that will allow users to interact with your smart contract.

```tsx title="components/ContractInteraction.tsx"
import * as React from "react";

export const ContractInteraction = () => {
  return <button>Send</button>;
};
```

#### Step 2: Configure wagmi's `useWriteContract` hook

Add wagmi's `useWriteContract` hook and configure `writeContractAsync` with the parameters: `abi`, `address`, `functionName`, `value` and `args`. Get the ABI and address of your smart contract from the DeployedContracts or you can grab it from ExternalContracts object, those will be used to set up the contract interaction.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
// highlight-start
import { parseEther } from "viem";
import { useWriteContract } from "wagmi";
import DeployedContracts from "~~/contracts/deployedContracts";
// highlight-end

export const ContractInteraction = () => {
  // highlight-start
  const { writeContractAsync } = useWriteContract();

  const writeContractAsyncWithParams = () =>
    writeContractAsync({
      address: DeployedContracts[31337].YourContract.address,
      abi: DeployedContracts[31337].YourContract.abi,
      functionName: "setGreeting",
      value: parseEther("0.01"),
      args: ["Hello world!"],
    });
  // highlight-end
  return <button>Send</button>;
};
```

#### Step 3: Initialize `useTransactor` hook and send transaction

Initialize the `useTransactor` hook, and use it to wrap `writeContractAsyncWithParams` function which we got from `useWriteContract` to show feedback transaction status to user.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { parseEther } from "viem";
import { useWriteContract } from "wagmi";
import DeployedContracts from "~~/contracts/deployedContracts";
// highlight-start
import { useTransactor } from "~~/hooks/scaffold-eth";
// highlight-end

export const ContractInteraction = () => {
  const { writeContractAsync } = useWriteContract();

  const writeContractAsyncWithParams = () =>
    writeContractAsync({
      address: DeployedContracts[31337].YourContract.address,
      abi: DeployedContracts[31337].YourContract.abi,
      functionName: "setGreeting",
      value: parseEther("0.01"),
      args: ["Hello world!"],
    });

  // highlight-start
  const writeTx = useTransactor();
  // highlight-end

  // highlight-start
  return <button onClick={() => writeTx(writeContractAsyncWithParams, { blockConfirmations: 1 })}>Send</button>;
  // highlight-end
};
```

#### Step 4: Wrap `useTransactor` in a handler async function

Wrap the `writeTx` function in a handler function to start the transaction when the user clicks the button.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { parseEther } from "viem";
import { useWriteContract } from "wagmi";
import DeployedContracts from "~~/contracts/deployedContracts";
import { useTransactor } from "~~/hooks/scaffold-eth";

export const ContractInteraction = () => {
  const { writeContractAsync, isPending } = useWriteContract();

  const writeContractAsyncWithParams = () =>
  writeContractAsync({
    address: DeployedContracts[31337].YourContract.address,
    abi: DeployedContracts[31337].YourContract.abi,
    functionName: "setGreeting",
    value: parseEther("0.01"),
    args: ["Hello world!"],
  });

  const writeTx = useTransactor();

  // highlight-start
  const handleSetGreeting = async () => {
    try {
      await writeTx(writeContractAsyncWithParams, { blockConfirmations: 1 });
    } catch (e) {
      console.log("Unexpected error in writeTx", e);
    }
  };
  // highlight-end


  return (
    // highlight-start
    <button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={handleSetGreeting}>
      Send
    </button>
    // highlight-end
  );

```

#### Step 5: Bonus adding loading state

We can use `isPending` returned from `useWriteContract` while the transaction is being mined and also `disable` the button.

```tsx
import * as React from "react";
import { parseEther } from "viem";
import { useWriteContract } from "wagmi";
import DeployedContracts from "~~/contracts/deployedContracts";
import { useTransactor } from "~~/hooks/scaffold-eth";

export const ContractInteraction = () => {
  // highlight-start
  const { writeContractAsync, isPending } = useWriteContract();
  // highlight-end

  const writeContractAsyncWithParams = () =>
    writeContractAsync({
      address: DeployedContracts[31337].YourContract.address,
      abi: DeployedContracts[31337].YourContract.abi,
      functionName: "setGreeting",
      value: parseEther("0.01"),
      args: ["Hello world!"],
    });

  const writeTx = useTransactor();

  const handleSetGreeting = async () => {
    try {
      await writeTx(writeContractAsyncWithParams, { blockConfirmations: 1 });
    } catch (e) {
      console.log("Unexpected error in writeTx", e);
    }
  };

  return (
    // highlight-start
    <button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={handleSetGreeting} disabled={isPending}>
      {isPending ? <span className="loading loading-spinner loading-sm"></span> : "Send"}
    </button>
    // highlight-end
  );
};
```

### WriteToContractWriteAsyncButton

Source: https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/recipes/WriteToContractWriteAsyncButton

#### Write to a Contract with `writeContractAsync` button

This recipe shows how to implement a button that allows users to interact with a smart contract by executing the `writeContractAsync` function returned by [useScaffoldWriteContract](/hooks/useScaffoldWriteContract). By following this guide, you can create a user interface for writing data to a contract.

<details open>
<summary>Here is the full code, which we will be implementing in the guide below:</summary>

```tsx title="components/Greetings.tsx"
import { useState } from "react";
import { parseEther } from "viem";
import { useScaffoldWriteContract } from "~~/hooks/scaffold-eth";

export const Greetings = () => {
  const [newGreeting, setNewGreeting] = useState("");

  const { writeContractAsync, isPending } = useScaffoldWriteContract("YourContract");

  const handleSetGreeting = async () => {
    try {
      await writeContractAsync(
        {
          functionName: "setGreeting",
          args: [newGreeting],
          value: parseEther("0.01"),
        },
        {
          onBlockConfirmation: txnReceipt => {
            console.log("📦 Transaction blockHash", txnReceipt.blockHash);
          },
        },
      );
    } catch (e) {
      console.error("Error setting greeting", e);
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Write your greeting"
        className="input border border-primary"
        onChange={e => setNewGreeting(e.target.value)}
      />
      <button className="btn btn-primary" onClick={handleSetGreeting} disabled={isPending}>
        {isPending ? <span className="loading loading-spinner loading-sm"></span> : "Send"}
      </button>
    </>
  );
};
```

</details>

#### Implementation

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Component

Create a new component in the "components" folder. This component will enable users to write data to a smart contract.

```tsx title="components/Greetings.tsx"
export const Greetings = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <input type="text" placeholder="Write your greeting" className="input border border-primary" />
      <button>Send</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

#### Step 2: Initialize `useScaffoldWriteContract` hook

Initialize the `useScaffoldWriteContract` hook. This hook provides the `writeContractAsync` function for sending transactions, we'll create `handleSetGreeting` function in which we'll call and pass parameters to `writeContractAsync` required to perform contract interaction.

```tsx
// highlight-start
import { useState } from "react";
import { parseEther } from "viem";
import { useScaffoldWriteContract } from "~~/hooks/scaffold-eth";
// highlight-end

export const Greetings = () => {
  // highlight-start
  const [newGreeting, setNewGreeting] = useState("");
  // highlight-end

  // highlight-start
  const { writeContractAsync } = useScaffoldWriteContract("YourContract");
  // highlight-end

  // highlight-start
  const handleSetGreeting = async () => {
    try {
      await writeContractAsync(
        {
          functionName: "setGreeting",
          args: [newGreeting],
          value: parseEther("0.01"),
        },
        {
          onBlockConfirmation: txnReceipt => {
            console.log("📦 Transaction blockHash", txnReceipt.blockHash);
          },
        },
      );
    } catch (e) {
      console.error("Error setting greeting", e);
    }
  };
  // highlight-end

  return (
    <>
      <input type="text" placeholder="Write your greeting" className="input border border-primary" />
      <button>Send</button>
    </>
  );
};
```

#### Step 3: Add input change logic and send transaction when users click the button

Wire up the input field to update the `newGreeting` state when the user types in a new greeting and call `handleSetGreeting` function when user click on the button.

```tsx
import { parseEther } from "viem";
import { useScaffoldWriteContract } from "~~/hooks/scaffold-eth";

export const Greetings = () => {
  const [newGreeting, setNewGreeting] = useState("");

  const { writeContractAsync } = useScaffoldWriteContract("YourContract");

  const handleSetGreeting = async () => {
    try {
      await writeContractAsync(
        {
          functionName: "setGreeting",
          args: [newGreeting],
          value: parseEther("0.01"),
        },
        {
          onBlockConfirmation: txnReceipt => {
            console.log("📦 Transaction blockHash", txnReceipt.blockHash);
          },
        },
      );
    } catch (e) {
      console.error("Error setting greeting", e);
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Write your greeting"
        className="input border border-primary"
        // highlight-start
        onChange={e => setNewGreeting(e.target.value)}
        // highlight-end
      />
      <button
        className="btn btn-primary"
        // highlight-start
        onClick={handleSetGreeting}
        // highlight-end
      >
        Send
      </button>
    </>
  );
};
```

#### Step 4: Bonus adding loading state

We can use `isPending` returned from `useScaffoldWriteContract` while the transaction is being mined and also disable the button.

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { parseEther } from "viem";
import { useScaffoldWriteContract } from "~~/hooks/scaffold-eth";

export const Greetings = () => {
  const [newGreeting, setNewGreeting] = useState("");
  // highlight-start
  const { writeContractAsync, isPending } = useScaffoldWriteContract("YourContract");
  // highlight-end

  const handleSetGreeting = async () => {
    try {
      await writeContractAsync(
        {
          functionName: "setGreeting",
          args: [newGreeting],
          value: parseEther("0.01"),
        },
        {
          onBlockConfirmation: txnReceipt => {
            console.log("📦 Transaction blockHash", txnReceipt.blockHash);
          },
        },
      );
    } catch (e) {
      console.error("Error setting greeting", e);
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Write your greeting"
        className="input border border-primary"
        onChange={e => setNewGreeting(e.target.value)}
      />

      <button
        className="btn btn-primary"
        onClick={handleSetGreeting}
        // highlight-start
        disabled={isPending}
      >
        {isPending ? <span className="loading loading-spinner loading-sm"></span> : "Send"}
      </button>
    </>
    // highlight-end
  );
};
```
