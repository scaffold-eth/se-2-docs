# Scaffold-ETH 2 Docs

This website contains Scaffold-ETH 2 Documentation and is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Requirements

To run the Documentation site locally, but first ensure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.

## Installation

Clone the repository, install all dependencies as well as build all local packages, and then start Docusaurus.

```
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/se2-docs.git
cd se2-docs
npm install
npm run start
```

### Run docs with search feature enabled

Instead of `npm run start`, you'll need to:

```bash
npm run docusaurus build
npm run docusaurus serve
```

If you change the [search configuration](/docusaurus.config.js#L27), you'll need to run `npm run docusaurus build` and then `npm run docusaurus serve` again to refresh with the changes.

## Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to improve the documentation!

There are two types of contributions you can make:

- Fix errors or add new pages to the current documentation content.
- Fix bugs or introduce new features to the documentation website (within the Docusaurus codebase).

## Content contributions

The documentation content is written in Markdown format and is located in the `docs` folder. If youâ€™re not familiar with Markdown, please check this [guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) or this [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to get started.

MDX files are also present, they combine Markdown with React. You can learn more about MDX files in [Docusaurus docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react).

### Existing content

If you find anything that is confusing or can be improved in an existing document, you can click **"Edit this page" at the bottom of the page**, which will redirect to the GitHub edit form of that document. Make your changes and submit a pull request (PR).

### New content

When **adding a new page**, you need to fork the repository, create a new branch, and make all changes necessary in your repository. Once you are done with your changes, create a PR to Scaffold-ETH 2 Documentation repository.

Add the new pages to the `docs` folder, placing them in the specific directory where you want the page to be shown.
**Sidebar** link will get **autogenerated** under your specific folder, in the **position** that you specify in your document header. Example:

```markdown
---
sidebar_position: 2
---
```

If you want to **create a new folder** to the Document structure, you'll need to add the new folder and a markdown document with the same name of that folder, which will be displayed when the users click on the sidebar link.

## Website contributions

For contributions to the Website Code, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr).

Fork the repository, create a new branch, and make all changes necessary in your repository. Once you are done with your changes, create a PR to Scaffold-ETH 2 Documentation repository.

### Configuration

- `docusaurus.config.js` - This file contains the Docusaurus configuration. Here you can manage site metadata, links in the header and footer, and theme configuration. You can visit [Docusaurus docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/configuration) to learn more about the Docusaurus settings.

### Sidebars

- `sidebars.js` - This specifies the sidebars for your documentation. You'll see that we currently have `type: 'autogenerated'` configured for the sidebar. This will generate sidebar menu links based on the folder structure and positions defined in each document.

  The full documentation for this file is available on the [Docusaurus website](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar).

### Styles

- `src/css/custom.css` - This file contains our custom modifications on top of the Docusaurus 'classic' theme. For in-depth understanding of [Docusaurus Styling and Layout](https://docusaurus.io/docs/styling-layout) you can visit their docs, where you will find the Theme Class Names in order to modify them in our `custom.css`.

If there's something overlooked in this `README.md` or if any instructions are unclear, remember you can also contribute to improve it. **Fork, modify and PR to our repository!**

All contributions are welcome!
